# NER-using-BERT

## Overview
This project fine-tunes the BERT-base model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks using the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The NER system identifies and classifies entities such as persons, organizations, and locations within unstructured text data.

## Dataset
The CoNLL-2003 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for NER tasks. It consists of English news articles from the Reuters corpus annotated with named entity labels. The dataset contains entities such as persons, organizations, locations, and miscellaneous entities.

* Size: The dataset comprises approximately 14,000 sentences across train, validation, and test sets.
* Labels: Each token in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding named entity type, including entities such as PER (person), ORG (organization), LOC (location), and MISC (miscellaneous).
* Usage: The dataset is commonly used for training and evaluating NER models, providing a standardized benchmark for measuring model performance.
* Data Split: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with predefined splits to facilitate consistent evaluation of model performance.

## About BERT and how it used in this project

BERT Base Model:
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained transformer-based model widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Bidirectional Context:
BERT captures bidirectional context by pre-training on large text corpora, learning rich, contextualized representations of words and phrases.

Fine-tuning for NER:
In your project, the BERT base model is fine-tuned on the CoNLL-2003 dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, enabling it to accurately identify and classify entities within text data.

Transformer Architecture:
BERT base consists of transformer blocks with self-attention mechanisms, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and relationships between words in the input sequence.

Tokenization:
BERT uses subword tokenization to handle out-of-vocabulary words and capture morphological variations effectively, enhancing its performance in NER tasks.

Model Adaptability:
By fine-tuning BERT on the CoNLL-2003 dataset, your project demonstrates how the model can be adapted to specific NLP tasks, achieving competitive performance in entity recognition.
